steps:-
    1)Create lists by adding in input box and hitting enter
    2)If main pages is cluttered with lots of data then you can dynamically create new pages by just adding any name at the end of the path
      for eg: /Home or /College => 
      https://sheltered-ridge-36606.herokuapp.com/Home or https://sheltered-ridge-36606.herokuapp.com/College
    3)Don't worry everything is stored in mongo's Database and its smart enough to perform CRUD operations
    4)Tech stack - Node, Express, Mongodb, Mongoose, EJS, JS, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS etc.
